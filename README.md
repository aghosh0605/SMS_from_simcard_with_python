# SMS_from_simcard_with_python3
The most efficient way to send SMS from your mobile. No APN required.


## !!!First install the requirments to use the ping code.!!! 
1. Use `chmod +x req_sms_send.sh` on that directory where the file stays to make it executable. 

2. Install the requirments by `./req_sms_send.sh` on that same path.

3. Setup Airmore on your mobile. ( Link added on req_sms_send.sh output )

## Run the code :)
1. Note down the **ip and port number** provided on the app. ( To check use three dots at right side of the screen )
2. Use the same **ip and port** in the code input.
3. Check if the code prints **True**. That means all the connections are correct and ready to go. **Flase** means connection to Airmore Mobile is failed. Turn on Airmore because it is sometime killed automatically in background for battry optimisation.
4. Enter the number whom you want to send message with or **without STD code. Default is India STD code.**
5. Enter what to send to the receiver.
6. All of the **tariff charges** charged you are from the provider. We doesn't use anything to charge you.
